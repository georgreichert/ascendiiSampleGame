# ascendiiSampleGame
A sample game using the ascendii game engine I created, which can be found here: https://github.com/georgreichert/ascendii  
This game is part of an ongoing series of text based console games I am working on for a university course. It is a simple beat 'em up game with ascii graphics.

**This is work in progress - at the moment, only 1 vs 1 mode is available, new fighters can't be created, only existing ones can be used, and enemy AI is not available yet, both fighters have to be controled by keyboard input**
